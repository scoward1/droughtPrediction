### INSTALLING LIBRARIES IN PYTHON ###

the libraries need a compiler. in vsc, you can use the microsoft C++ build tools
link: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/
run the executable file that downloads
under 'workload', select c++ build tools
select: MSVC v142 - VS 2019 C++ x64/x86 build tools (v 14.26)
select: Windows 10 SDK (10.0.17763.0)
install

------- matplotlib -------
in terminal
    pip install matplotlib

in code
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np


------- pandas -------
in terminal 
    pip install pandas
    requires: matplotlib and numpy (numpy is downloaded with matplotlib)

in code
    import pandas as pd 


------- seaborn -------
usually you need to have LAPACK and BLAS installed. this is long and hard (i didn't do it, 
and also don't really know what they are). instead, you can download a 'wheel' for python s
that will allow you to install scipy first.
link: https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#scipy
select the wheel according to the device and version of python being used. you can check the
version that you're running by using 'python --version' in cmd. i have python 3.10, so i used
scipy‑1.7.1‑cp310‑cp310‑win_amd64.whl

in terminal
    pip install [Local File Location]\[Your specific file such as scipy‑1.7.1‑cp310‑cp310‑win_amd64.whl]
    pip install scipy
    pip install seaborn
    requires: matplotlib, numpy, scipy, pandas

in code
    import seaborn as sns

- you can check to see if a package is installed by using 'pip show packageName'
- these may require the editor to be restarted, so if you install something and it doesn't work try 
    reopening it
